// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The reconnect edge that stayed in pulse after the CDC layer took the connection loop.
// minipg's `replicate()` owns connect, slot administration, backoff and the retry budget, and
// tests those itself. What is still pulse policy — and only observable here — is WHICH session
// events rebuild consumer state: a rebaseline round must fire when a stream re-opens under live
// collections, and must not fire on the very first one, when no collection exists yet.
//
// `replicate()` is a free function, not a method on the runtime, so there is no instance seam to
// override — the module is mocked (live-binding update, per Bun's mock.module docs) to capture
// the options object, and the test drives the driver's callbacks directly.
